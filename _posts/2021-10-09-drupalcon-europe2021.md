title: DrupalCon Europe 2021
---

This was last DrupalCon Europe happend, the fourth Virtual DrupalCon and possibly the last one. For me, thas was enough incentive to participate, more on that later.

<!--more-->

The week started early for me (04:00 am), but that was a small price to pay for attend to a conference with a 5 hours timezone difference. The chosen platfform was [Hopin](https://hopin.com/), that worked pretty well with the limitations of a conference but enabling the participation and comunication of the participants.

A two screens setup, the Drupal Slack page, Drupal.org documentation, Hopin Event and many open browser tabs were the tools this time. I could say that gave a pretty close result as an in-person format at least in the learning experience.
The social contact is still missing, but you know we still have to be careful of crowded places :).

### Highlights

IMHO, these were the most interesting things I learn from this DrupalCon.

* Virtual conferences are useful for many people and many of us think that should be kept as an option for allow more diverse participation.
* DrupalPod.
* The Drupal initiatives have all great achievements
* Is necessary to keep lowering the barriers to new Drupalers
* The GitLab integration has made great achievements allowing a more "traditional" aproach to contribution to the project
* The credit system is great in the Drupal project and the Gitlab integraion can allow other comunities to recognize their contributors.
* Drupal 8 is almost out of time
* The migration to Drupal 9 of modules is pretty good
* The new projects/migrations continues growing
* We ha to think about Drupal 10


### Conclusion

This was my third DrupalCon, and the experience was so different to the other previous two. I hope that some kind of virtual participation continues to be available in future conferences allowing some kind of involvement to people not able to travel.

Big thanks to everyone, organizers, speakers, attendees, for another unforgettable Drupal event! Weâ€™re very happy to be able to experience and share the Drupal love even in these unusual times. We hope to see you all soon at an in-person conference. Till next time!
